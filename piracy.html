<h4 class="red-text center">Counterfeit &amp; Piracy Investigation</h4>
<p class="flow-text">Product Fraud is estimated to cost the legitimate owners millions of pounds each and every year. Forgers, imitators and counterfeiters do not just confine themselves to luxury products of international fame, such as watches, cigarette lighters, leather goods, clothing, perfumes and recorded music - motor car parts, aircraft components, pharmaceutical products and computer software programs are all very suitable products for the international imitator and counterfeiter.</p>
<p>Counterfeit consumer goods, commonly called 'Knock Offs', are counterfeit or imitation products offered for sale as if they were authentic. The spread of counterfeit goods has become global in recent years and the range of goods subject to infringement has increased significantly.</p>
<p>According to the study of Counterfeiting Intelligence Bureau (CIB) of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) counterfeit Goods make up 5 to 7% of World Trade.</p>
<p>'Piracy' refers primarily to copyrighted works traded in violation of copyright law. The term generally refers to illegal releases by organized groups, as opposed to file sharing between friends or large groups of people with similar interest using a darknet.</p>
<p>Third World nations, especially in Southeast Asia, have en masse copied corporate logos and names of primarily Western and Japanese companies. Some of these companies have even become listed on stock exchanges in their respective nations.</p>
<p>Companies suffer not only from loss of profits but even more because the goods are of inferior quality.
